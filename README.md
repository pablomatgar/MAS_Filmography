# MAS Filmography

Android (Java) app which would allow the user to store details of the actor Miguel Ángel Silvestre’s filmography, stored in a table in an SQLite database. This was one of the final assignments of the module COM502 - Internet and Mobile Application Development in Wrexham Glyndŵr University (United Kingdom).

### Difficulties and how I solved them

I consider that this app was not very difficult concerning programming, but it takes a lot of time. However, one of the points I would like to mention as difficult would be the possibility of searching by each different field of each table, as I needed to check the list the user is (that is, the table of the database) and the equivalent of the field in the SQL database format. Related to this, adding or erasing depending on the table was a bit hard as well, but not because of the actual code. It was harder to spend time thinking about how to solve it rather than the actual coding process.
